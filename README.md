# VM-Auto-Scaling-Project
This project implements an automated VM scaling solution using AWS services. It processes CSV files uploaded to an S3 bucket, reads VM requirements, and dynamically scales EC2 instances up or down using a Lambda function. The system ensures efficient resource allocation based on workload demands.
